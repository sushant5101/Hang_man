              I am trying to make a hang man game using c language. I have make a first version of the game it was working fine and i was configuring the easy function and i messed up some ware so it has got broken some so i did not want  to  start in a  same file again so i am making a repo and publishing the progress of my journey. I decided to work from scratch and create the second version of the game that hope fully can be completed without any intruption.
