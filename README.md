# Hang_man

Hang_man_v1.0: I am trying to make a Hangman game using C language. I created the first version of the game, and it was working fine. However, while configuring the "easy" function, I messed up somewhere, and the game broke. I decided not to work on the same file again. Instead, I am creating a repository to document the progress of my journey. I have decided to start from scratch and create the second version of the game, which I hope can be completed without interruptions.

Hang_man_v1.1: I am currently working on the second version of the Hangman game. At this point, it is in the same stage as the first version, as I am working on the "easy" function. I am trying to handle the entered input, checking logic, and more. I hope I don’t get stuck in the same function twice. If I do face issues, I’d prefer they are different ones. Let’s see how it goes! I will make commits along the way, even if I delete some code, as it might help in recovering any useful portions later.

Hang_man_v1.2: In this update, I made progress! I finally completed the logic for the "easy" level. In "Hang_man_v1.0," the code had 157 lines, but I managed to reduce it by 84 lines in this version. This was because I removed the duplicate-checking logic. I may add it back after completing all the functions. The duplicate-checking logic might only be necessary when replacing the "_" with the corresponding letter. I still need to implement the actual Hangman logic. With one function completed, I will now move on to the next one. I think this will be faster since I only need to tweak some of the checking logic for other levels.

Hang_man_v1.3: I fixed some errors in the "easy" level function. There were some problematic code blocks that I had missed earlier. There might still be more issues, and if I notice them, I will fix them as soon as possible.

Hang_man_v1.4: implemented the function to handel medium and hard level, Remaining to add the function to display a hangman ASCII art on wrong gueses. The writing process of the two function were the same as the easy in this uplode i changed some of the local variable to global variabe for easy and comfortabe reading.
